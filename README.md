Knights and Castles


A simple noninteractive game in which knights fight for domination over a particular castle. 
There are 3 castles and randomly created knights with randomly generated stats (hp,def,dmg) and a vector of movement. 
If a knight encounters a castle he tries to enter it. If a castle is empty he simply enters (condition variable wait)
it but if a castle is already occupied a fight between them occurs.
